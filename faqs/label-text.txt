provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,

Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the
Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Apache License version 2.0 15

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW

1. Definitions
"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other preexisting
works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of
music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance
and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the
original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work
in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation
for the purpose of this License.
"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject
matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection
and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work
is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection
will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
License.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work
or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work

individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be
identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors,
singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,
interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii)

such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or

performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered
a literary or artistic work.

previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has
received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including
by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the
public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from
a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of
the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the
Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing
fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in
digital form or other electronic medium.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict
any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are
provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the
applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to
Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including
any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License 19
translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to
Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections;
and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be
waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to
collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,
the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
You of the rights granted under this License; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any
exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as
are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to
Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License.
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License
with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create
an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You
must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
Open Source License and Copyright Information
20 Pivotal Ready Architecture 1.0 Open Source License and Copyright Information
of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
"French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
Attribution Parties.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in
those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section
3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national
law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
(right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any
breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received
Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to
stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License 21
to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the
recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented
to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were
drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome
Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction
in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

Introduction
The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may
contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which
rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project. This license applies to all files found in such
packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects
thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at
the very least. This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent
JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in
commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that: o
We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind
of bug reports. (`as is' distribution) o You can use this software for whatever you
want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage) o You may
not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program,
you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the
FreeType code. (`credits') We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this
software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all
warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The
FreeType Project. Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/
Eclipse Public License version 1.0 23
disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the
following text: """ Portions of this software are copyright 􀯭 <year> The FreeType
Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. """ Please replace <year> with the
value from the FreeType version you actually use.

Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as
alpha, beta or final release. `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project,
where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well
as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program is referred to as `a
program using the FreeType engine'. This license applies to all files distributed in the
original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation,
unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the
original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this
license, you must contact us to verify this. The FreeType Project is copyright (C)
1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved
except as specified below.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but changing it is not allowed.
0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and
useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a
way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the
document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with
manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not
limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document
specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this
License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
11. RELICENSING
GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3 25
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World Wide
Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities
for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of
such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license
published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a
principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft
versions of that license published by that same organization.
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of
another Document.
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works
that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and
subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or
invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CCBY-
SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is
eligible for relicensing.
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in
the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title
page:
Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME.
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
Free Documentation License".
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the
"with … Texts." line with this:
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the
three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as
the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your Freedom to share and
change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all
its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library
General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,
you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that
they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms
so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you
this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone
understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to
avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent
licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it
clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed
by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General
Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
"work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this
License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,
and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
GNU General Public License version 2.0 27
based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 a bove, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:
a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
changed the files and the date of any change.
b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part
contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a
whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:
if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an
announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections
of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to
work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2)
in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
provided that you also do one of the following:
a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any
third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
Open Source License and Copyright Information
28 Pivotal Ready Architecture 1.0 Open Source License and Copyright Information
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which
the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. . You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based
on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works
based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may
not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for
any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions
of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a
whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
GNU General Public License version 2.0 29
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other
property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system,
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/
donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted
only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST
OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to
the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone
can redistribute and change under these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them
to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to
where the full notice is found.
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License
for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place,
Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in
an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free
software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type
`show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouseclicks
or menu items--whatever suits your program.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a
sample; alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it
more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is
what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this
License.
GNU General Public License version 2.0 31
IBM Public License version 1.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
AGREEMENT.
1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:
in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), the Original
Program, and
in the case of each Contributor,
changes to the Program, and
additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting
on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the
Program.
"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined
with the Program.
"Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying this
Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and
documentation, if any.
"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including
all Contributors.
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
and object code form.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,
use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes
such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its
Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the
Open Source License and Copyright Information
32 Pivotal Ready Architecture 1.0 Open Source License and Copyright Information
Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any
other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
license before distributing the Program.
Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in
its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own
license agreement, provided that:
it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
its license agreement:
effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions,
express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose;
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including
direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that
Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and
informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:
it must be made available under this Agreement; and
a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:
Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All
Rights Reserved.
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect
to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate
the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
IBM Public License version 1.0 33
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related
to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
and unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE
USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this
Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent
applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any
patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes
patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any
of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in
a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all
Open Source License and Copyright Information
34 Pivotal Ready Architecture 1.0 Open Source License and Copyright Information
Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the
Program shall continue and survive.
IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version
number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new
version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than IBM
has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a)
and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are
reserved.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a
legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose.
Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

but changing it is not allowed.
[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes
with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and
change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free
for all its users.
ISC License 35
This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated
Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide
to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies
of the library, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you
must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they,
too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you
must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with
the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show
them these terms so they know their rights.
Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the library.
Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone
understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by
someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is
not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to
avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain
patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To
prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General
Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite
different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that
anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.
The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the
distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply
using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense
simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application
program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined
work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats
it as such.
Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for
libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did
not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing
better.
However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those
programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library
General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use
free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the
Open Source License and Copyright Information
36 Pivotal Ready Architecture 1.0 Open Source License and Copyright Information
free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as
regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the
actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development
of free libraries.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay
close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work
that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, while the
latter only works together with the library.
Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public
License rather than by this special one.
GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be
conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and
data) to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term "modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for
all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this
License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is
not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool
for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the
program that uses the Library does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and
distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your
option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming
a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you
changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.
GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.0 37
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be
supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument
passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still
operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For
example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that
any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the
application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square
roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of
that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when
you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the
Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole , and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work
written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead
of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices
that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public
License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the
ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative
works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a
program that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machinereadable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated
place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed
to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses
the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable
that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather
Open Source License and Copyright Information
38 Pivotal Ready Architecture 1.0 Open Source License and Copyright Information
than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this
License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the
Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even
though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this
to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length),
then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library
will still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object
code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they
are linked directly with the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that
uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the
Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering
for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in
it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy
of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must
include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must
be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as
object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then
relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library
will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
definitions.)
b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the
same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than
the cost of performing this distribution.
c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated
place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same
place.
d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have
already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include
any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However,
as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
unless that component itself accompani es the executable.
GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.0 39
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an
executable that you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a
single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work
based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and
provided that you do these two things:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under
the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work
based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative
works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library),
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute,
link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for
any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library
at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a
whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other
property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole
purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance
on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
Open Source License and Copyright Information
40 Pivotal Ready Architecture 1.0 Open Source License and Copyright Information
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either
by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countryes, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version
number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option
of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose
distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the
public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and
change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,
alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where
the full notice is found.
<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms
of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Library General Public License for
more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public License along with
this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place -
Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample;
alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library

GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.0
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and
conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public
License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
Open Source License and Copyright Information
42 Pivotal Ready Architecture 1.0 Open Source License and Copyright Information
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library,
but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined
by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with
the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was
made is also called the “Linked Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding
Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on
the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code
and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed
for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System
Libraries of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a
function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than
as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy
of the modified version:
a. under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still
operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
b. under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License
applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file
that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your
choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical
parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions
and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
a. Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b. Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such
modifications, if you also do each of the following:
a. Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b. Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.
c. For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include
the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.0 43
d. Do one of the following:
a. Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under
terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a
modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined
Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
Corresponding Source.
b. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible
with the Linked Version.
e. Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to
provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the
extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified
version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option
4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding
Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the
GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in
a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and
are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms
of your choice, if you do both of the following:
a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms
of this License.
b. Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based
on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does
not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may
choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by

3. Distribution Obligations.
3.1. Application of License.
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code
version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy
of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer
or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
3.2. Availability of Source Code.
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available
in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to
whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after
the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You
are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
3.3. Description of Modifications.
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any
Mozilla Public License version 1.1 47
change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any
notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
(a) Third Party Claims
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property
rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1
or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
"LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge
after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter
and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
knowledge has been obtained.
(b) Contributor APIs
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the legal file.
(c) Representations.
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4a above,
Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
this License.
3.5. Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then
You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You
must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
offer.
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have
fulfilled the obligations of Section 32. The notice must be conspicuously included in
any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable
Open Source License and Copyright Information
48 Pivotal Ready Architecture 1.0 Open Source License and Copyright Information
version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of any such terms You offer.
3.7. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
fulfilled for the Covered Code.
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect
to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then
You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.
5. Application of this License.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
6. Versions of the License.
6.1. New Versions
Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new
versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number.
6.2. Effect of New Versions
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You
may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to
use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
6.3. Derivative Works
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order
to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You
must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL",
"Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not
of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
7. Disclaimer of warranty
Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis, without warranty of
any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the
covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or noninfringing.
The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the covered code is
with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not the initial
developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair
Mozilla Public License version 1.1 49
or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license.
No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.
8. Termination
8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You
fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are
properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
survive.
8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
"Participant") alleging that:
1. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 21
and/or 22 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 21 and/or 22
automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
above.
2. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor
Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You
by such Participant under Sections 2.1b and 2.2b are revoked effective as of the
date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by
that Participant.
8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such
claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
amount or value of any payment or license.
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by
You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
9. Limitation of liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any other
contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any of such parties,
be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages
or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such
damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal
injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits
such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental
or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.

International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply
to this License.
12. Responsibility for claims
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims
and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute
such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed
to constitute any admission of liability.

provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your
grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the noncompliance
by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some
reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance
with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days
after Your receipt of the notice.
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging
that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights
granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1
of this License shall terminate.
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by
You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive
termination.
6. Disclaimer of Warranty
Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty
of any kind, either expressed, implied, or *statutory, including, without limitation,
warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in
any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except
under this disclaimer.
7. Limitation of Liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes
Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do
not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this
exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
8. Litigation
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction
where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall
be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law
provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims
or counter-claims.
9. Miscellaneous
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall
be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation
which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

VIM License
vim 7.2
http://www.vim.org/
vim-base 7.2
http://www.vim.org/
VIM LICENSE
I) There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except that they
must include this license text. You can also distribute unmodified parts of Vim, likewise
unrestricted except that they must include this license text. You are also allowed to
include executables that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own
usage examples and Vim scripts.
II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim, including
executables and/or source code, when the following four conditions are met:
1) This license text must be included unmodified.
2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in the distribution
how to contact you. When the maintainer asks you (in any way) for a copy of the
modified Vim you distributed, you must make your changes, including source code,
available to the maintainer without fee. The maintainer reserves the right to include
your changes in the official version of Vim. What the maintainer will do with your
changes and under what license they will be distributed is negotiable. If there has been
no negotiation then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this changes it will be
announced in appropriate places (most likely vim.sf.net, ww.vim.org and/or
comp.editors). When it is completely impossible to contact the maintainer, the
obligation to send him your changes ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that
he has received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
VIM License 63
b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as mentioned under a) you
are allowed to further distribute it unmodified, as mentioned at I). If you make
additional changes the text under a) applies to those changes.
c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of the modified Vim
you distribute. This may be done in the form of a context diff. You can choose what
license to use for new code you add. The changes and their license must not restrict
others from making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned under c), you
can distribute it without the source code for the changes if the following three
conditions are met:
- The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute the changes to the
Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and permits the Vim maintainer to include
the changes in the official version of Vim without fee or restriction.
- You keep the changes for at least three years after last distributing the
corresponding modified Vim. When the maintainer or someone who you distributed the
modified Vim to asks you (in any way) for the changes within this period, you must
make them available to him.
- You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you. This contact information
must remain valid for at least three years after last distributing the corresponding
modified Vim, or as long as possible.
e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes, you can
distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later version.
3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version" command and in
the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim is able to see that it was
modified. When distributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding the message is only
required for as far as this does not conflict with the license used for the changes.
4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be removed or
changed, except that the person himself can make corrections.
III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use the Vim
license for your changes and make them available to the maintainer, including the
source code. The preferred way to do this is by e-mail or by uploading the files to a
server and e-mailing the URL. If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified
Makefile) e-mailing a context diff will do. The e-mail address to be used is
<maintainer@vim.org>
IV) It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim sources,
parts of it or from a modified version. You may use this license for previous Vim
releases instead of the license that they came with, at your option.
Note:
- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this file and
consider helping needy children in Uganda.
- If you want to support further Vim development consider becoming a |sponsor|. The
money goes to Uganda anyway.
- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible. A few minor
changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not make a difference.
- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits further
distribution to the GNU GPL. Also when you didn't actually change anything in Vim.
- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all further
changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.

information with the "--with-modified-by" configure argument or the MODIFIED_BY
define.
